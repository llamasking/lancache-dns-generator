# lancache-dns-generator

Generates and serves filter lists for LanCache.

Serves a small webserver which downloads the latest set of domains from https://github.com/uklans/cache-domains and converts them to a filter list for AdGuard Home.

Created simply for my own convenience.

Documentation: Maybe someday.
